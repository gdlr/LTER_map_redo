Nearly four decades of KNZ LTER research has produced a rich, detailed, and evolving understanding of how fire, grazing, and climate interact to shape the structure and function of mesic grasslands. This has provided researchers with a unique opportunity to identify key drivers and mechanisms underlying ecosystem state change. Variations in fire frequency, grazing intensity, grassland restoration, nutrient input, and climate regimes have resulted in divergent ecosystem states with non-linear dynamics and strong legacy effects. By evaluating long term responses to these drivers, KNZ LTER researchers have identified thresholds, warning signs that precede state shifts, legacies, and hysteresis.

Due to their fluctuating nature, drylands are excellent settings to investigate the ecological consequences of environmental variability. The Sevilleta (SEV) LTER site represents the convergence of six major North American dryland ecosystems – pinon-juniper woodlands, juniper savannas, riparian cottonwood forests, plains grasslands, and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands and shrublands. Combined, these ecosystems create a powerful opportunity to test how ecosystem structure and function respond to environmental variability and change. 

The SEV LTER program spans 30 years of long term data, experiments, specimen archives, and theory. Sevilleta LTER researchers are developing new theories to predict the consequences of environmental variability over space, time, and biological scales and generating the long term data needed to test these predictions. Current research is focused on the question: How do long term trends in climate variability drive the dynamics of dryland ecosystems and transitions among them?",NA

Research at the site is dedicated to understanding how sea-level rise, storms, and temperature extremes cause ecosystem transitions, and how state change in one ecosystem can propagate across the landscape through coupled dynamics. Over its history, the program has advanced state change theory for ecosystems dominated by foundation species, including feedbacks that either maintain or facilitate transitions, and leading indicators of tipping points. Through integrated studies of ecological and physical processes that include long term observations, experimental data, and mechanistic models, VCR LTER researchers are global leaders in predicting the impacts of climate on coastal ecosystems. Addressing the complexity and interdependence of ecosystems on the landscape is a critical frontier in projecting long term responses and resilience to climate change.",NA
